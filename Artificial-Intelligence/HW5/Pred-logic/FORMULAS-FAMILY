# These are some formulas that are true in the structure in STRUCT-FAMILY.
# Notice that these formulas are FALSE in many other structures. In particular,
# the 'parent' relation does not have to be aymmetric and could well contain
# cycles of length 2. It completely depends on how we define that relation.
# Of course, 'parent' relations with cycles in them would not correspond
# to the reality, but there is nothing illogical in them per se.


# The parent relation is asymmetric.

forall x forall y (parent(x,y) => not parent(y,x))


# The parent relation has no cycles of length 2.

forall x forall y forall z (parent(x,y) & parent(y,z) => x != z)


# The person designated by GRANPA is a grandparent of a male person.

exists x exists y (parent(GRANPA,x) & parent(x,y) & male(y))


# Everybody has a male parent or a male child.

forall x ( (exists y (parent(y,x) and male(y))) or (exists z (parent(x,z) and male(z))))
