# TASK: Define a structure so that formulas in FORMULAS-1 are true in it.

# First define the universe. It has to be non-empty. Otherwise you are free
# to choose its elements. The elements here can be integers and alpha-numeric
# identifiers. Note that the elements in the universe cannot be referred to
# in the formulas directly. All references to the elements are either through
# a constant symbol (with a fixed element of the universe attached to each
# constant symbol), or through quantification FORALL and EXISTS, which iterate
# through all elements of the universe.
# If you find the distinction between constant symbols and the entities in
# the universe confusing, you could use numbers 0, 1, 2, ... as the universe.

# The universe

{ 1 }

# Next you define the meanings of the predicates. Each predicate is associated with
# a set (1-place relation) or a relation (one or more places/columns) over the universe.
# The sets/relations can be empty or non-empty.
# Each predicate definition has the form 'name / arity = { }', where 'name' is
# the predicate's name and the 'arity' is an integer that indicates how many
# places/columns the predicate has.

# The predicates

connect / 2 = { }

P / 1 = { }

parent / 2 = { }
grandparent / 2 = { }
sibling / 2 = { }
male / 1 = { }
female / 1 = { }
father / 1 = { }

# Constant symbols are "names" that can be referred to in the formulas.
# Each constant symbols is associated with one element of the universe.
# More than one symbol can be associated with the same element.

# Constant symbols

Mary = 1
John = 1
Jack = 1
Anne = 1

# Hint: Since the predicates and constants about family relations are
# disjoint from the ones in graphs/connections, you can freely choose if
# you use the same universe elements in both categories of predicates,
# of if you decide to use disjoint sets of universe elements for each.
